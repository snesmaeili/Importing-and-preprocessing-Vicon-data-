# Importing c3d file from Vicon- Preprocess EMG and kinematic data - Extracting muscle and kinematic synergies

This repository contains code for the paper titled "The association between motor modules and movement primitives of gait: A muscle and kinematic synergy study(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021929022000537?via%3Dihub)", published in [Journal of Biomechanics, 2022].

## Introduction

This project deals with the importation and preprocessing of data from Vicon c3d files. We preprocessed the Electromyography (EMG) data and kinematic data, extracted muscle and kinematic synergies, and performed a clustering analysis on them.

## Data

The data used for this project is derived from Vicon c3d files. This data contains EMG and kinematic data which is preprocessed and analysed.

## Workflow

1. **Data Importation:** The raw data was imported from Vicon c3d files.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The imported EMG and kinematic data was preprocessed to facilitate further analysis.
3. **Extraction of Synergies:** Muscle and kinematic synergies were extracted from the preprocessed data.
4. **Clustering:** The extracted synergies were then subjected to clustering analysis.
